Assignment 1

I followed and read all the links that were on the index.ipynd on the top directory.

This tutorial is a little hard to follow and I think I did everything. 

However, digging around the full repo, I found examples and exercieses that were not linked in the main index.

When I tried to do the exercises, many of them were not really exercises, but just examples.

I did all of them.

I'm not sure if there is anything from the tutorial that you are looking that we did, I made an assignment 1.ipynd that has my following of the main tutorial.
